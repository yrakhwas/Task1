        <h1>Vehicle</h1>

        <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles
            include
            wagons,
            bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft
            (ships,
            boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and
            spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

        <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
            wheeled,
            tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road
            vehicles
            types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
